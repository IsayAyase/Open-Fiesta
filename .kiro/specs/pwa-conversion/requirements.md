# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PWA (Progressive Web App) conversion transforms Open-Fiesta into a native app-like experience that can be installed on desktop and mobile devices. This feature addresses the need for offline functionality, improved performance, native device integration, and app-store distribution while maintaining the existing web-based architecture. The solution leverages modern web technologies including service workers, web app manifest, and native APIs to provide a seamless cross-platform experience.
